# FizzBuzz test in PHP

FizzBuzz is a game usually asked to pass in programming job interviews. Other than solving the game correctly, it aims to highlight the programmer understanding of the basic and necessary tools such as if/else statements and loops.

The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:

“Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print ‘Fizz’ instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ‘Buzz’. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print ‘FizzBuzz’.”
